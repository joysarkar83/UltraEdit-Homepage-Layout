## What I Learned
1. Practiced translating a live webpage layout into a static replica using only HTML and CSS.
2. Improved structure, positioning, and styling—especially working with assets from the Source Images folder.

## Limitations
1. Static only, no interactivity or JavaScript.
2. Not responsive, layout may break on mobile/tablet.
3. Built purely for educational purposes, no affiliation with UltraEdit.
